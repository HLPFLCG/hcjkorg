                        Welcome to HCJK Collection. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our photography services 
                        and website. By booking our services or using our website, you agree to these Terms. Please read them carefully.
                    </p>

                    <h2>1. Service Agreement</h2>
                    <h3>1.1 Booking and Deposits</h3>
                    <p>
                        All photography sessions require a signed contract and non-refundable deposit to secure your date. 
                        The deposit amount varies by package and will be applied to your total balance. Dates are not reserved 
                        until both the signed contract and deposit are received.
                    </p>

                    <h3>1.2 Payment Terms</h3>
                    <p>
                        Full payment is due before or on the day of the photography session unless otherwise agreed upon in writing. 
                        We accept cash, check, credit cards, and electronic payments. Late payments may result in delayed delivery 
                        of final images and may incur additional fees.
                    </p>

                    <h3>1.3 Cancellation Policy</h3>
                    <p>
                        Deposits are non-refundable. If you need to cancel or reschedule, please notify us at least 14 days before 
                        your scheduled session. Cancellations made less than 14 days before the session will forfeit the deposit. 
                        One reschedule is permitted without additional fees; subsequent reschedules may incur a rescheduling fee.
                    </p>

                    <h2>2. Copyright and Intellectual Property</h2>
                    <h3>2.1 Photographer's Rights</h3>
                    <p>
                        HCJK Collection retains full copyright and intellectual property rights to all photographs created during 
                        your session. This includes, but is not limited to, the right to use the images for portfolio display, 
                        marketing materials, social media, website galleries, competitions, and promotional purposes.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2.2 Client Usage Rights</h3>
                    <p>
                        Upon full payment, clients receive a personal print release allowing them to print and share images for 
                        personal, non-commercial use. This includes posting on personal social media accounts, creating prints 
                        for personal display, and sharing with family and friends. Commercial use of any kind requires written 
                        permission and may require additional licensing fees.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2.3 Image Alterations</h3>
                    <p>
                        Clients may not alter, crop, edit, or apply filters to delivered images without express written permission. 
                        All images are professionally edited and color-corrected. Unauthorized alterations may misrepresent our 
                        work and are prohibited. If you require specific edits, please contact us to discuss options.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2.4 Credit and Attribution</h3>
                    <p>
                        When sharing images on social media or other platforms, we appreciate (but do not require) credit to 
                        HCJK Collection. However, you may not claim the photographs as your own work or remove any watermarks 
                        or copyright information.
                    </p>

                    <h2>3. Image Delivery and Selection</h2>
                    <h3>3.1 Delivery Timeline</h3>
                    <p>
                        Edited images will be delivered within 2-4 weeks for portrait sessions and 6-8 weeks for wedding photography. 
                        Rush delivery may be available for an additional fee. Delivery times are estimates and may vary based on 
                        our current workload and the complexity of editing required.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3.2 Image Selection</h3>
                    <p>
                        The photographer will select and deliver the best images from your session based on professional judgment. 
                        The number of delivered images varies by package but typically ranges from 30-100+ images depending on 
                        session length and type. We do not provide unedited images or RAW files.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3.3 Image Storage</h3>

                        Digital images will be available for download through our secure online gallery for 90 days after delivery. 
                        After this period, images may be archived. We recommend downloading and backing up your images promptly. 
                        Extended storage or re-delivery of archived images may incur additional fees.
                    </p>

                    <h2>4. Session Conduct and Expectations</h2>
                    <h3>4.1 Client Responsibilities</h3>
                    <p>
                        Clients are responsible for arriving on time and prepared for their session. This includes appropriate 
                        attire, props (if applicable), and any necessary permits for location shoots. Late arrivals may result 
                        in shortened session time without refund.
                    </p>

                    <h3>4.2 Weather and Unforeseen Circumstances</h3>
                    <p>
                        For outdoor sessions, we will monitor weather conditions and may need to reschedule due to inclement weather. 
                        In case of photographer illness, equipment failure, or other unforeseen circumstances, we will work with you 
                        to reschedule at no additional cost. We are not liable for circumstances beyond our control.
                    </p>

                    <h3>4.3 Behavior and Conduct</h3>
                    <p>
                        We expect all clients and their guests to treat our team with respect and professionalism. We reserve the 
                        right to terminate a session without refund if clients or their guests engage in abusive, threatening, or 
                        inappropriate behavior.
                    </p>

                    <h2>5. Liability and Indemnification</h2>

                    <p>
                        HCJK Collection's liability is limited to the amount paid for services. We are not responsible for injuries, 
                        damages, or losses that occur during photography sessions. Clients participate in sessions at their own risk.
                    </p>

                    <h3>5.2 Equipment Failure</h3>
                    <p>
                        While we use professional equipment and maintain backups, we are not liable for equipment failure, data loss, 
                        or corruption. We maintain comprehensive backup systems, but in the unlikely event of complete data loss, 
                        our liability is limited to a refund of fees paid.
                    </p>

                    <h3>5.3 Model Release</h3>
                    <p>
                        By booking our services, clients grant HCJK Collection permission to use photographs for promotional purposes 
                        as described in Section 2.1. If you do not wish your images to be used for marketing, please notify us in 
                        writing before your session.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We partner with professional labs to ensure the highest quality prints. However, we cannot guarantee exact 
                        color matching between digital images and prints due to variations in monitors, printers, and paper types. 
                        We are not responsible for prints made by third-party vendors.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Physical products will be shipped to the address provided. Clients are responsible for providing accurate 
                        shipping information. We are not responsible for lost or damaged shipments once they leave our possession, 
                        though we will work with shipping carriers to resolve issues.
                    </p>
